1) Title of your DIY Project: Hype Check

2) What have you worked on or accomplished this past week for your project or mentorship?
This past week, I have worked on expanding my dataset to include more movies, and also considering the factor of genre into my data.

3) Do you have any blockers? If so, what are they?
I am currently manually pulling any additional Google Trends data that I need, I would like to find a way to automate this again without Google Trends blocking my IP Address (currently using pytrends requests).

4) What do you intend to work on next week?
I am going to explore usine ChromeDriver and Selenium to lessen my chances of having my IP Address blocked. I also want to create graphs that are interactive, and will work on switching from matplotlib to Plotly or Bokeh so I can add fun features like hover tooltips or a legend toggle!
